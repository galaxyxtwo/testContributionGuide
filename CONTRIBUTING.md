# Contributing to Lilypad

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Lilypad Network! Welcome, we are happy to have you. 🐸 💚

There are opportunities to contribute to the Lilypad network at most levels of the stack. It doesn't matter you’re a experienced developer or just starting out, we can use your help!

For any questions, check out the [Lilypad docs](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad) and join our [Discord](https://lilypad.team/discord). Feel free to open a question in the [#i-need-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1212897693450641498/1230231823674642513).

This guide will help you get started with contributing to the Lilypad network. There are a variety of ways to get involved in the network! Feel free to contact our team through the [Lilypad Discord](https://lilypad.team/discord) to bring up problems and ask questions. In order to bring up or help solve a bug, contact our team and open a github issue. Our team will review the issue, look to see if the work is already in progress, and then finalize whether or not this PR should be merged.

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to abide by our [Code of Conduct](GitHub/testContributionGuide/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the code of conduct can be reported to the Lilypad team at contact@lilypad.tech.

## Contact on Discord

Alerting the team to an issue: Bugs can be brought up in the [#i-need-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1212897693450641498/1230231823674642513) in the Lilypad Discord. For Resource Providers and Job creators, please use the Ticketing format [here](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/hardware-providers/troubleshooting#dont-see-your-issue-below) to ensure a smooth exchange of info!

## Issues

Open an Issue: We ask community members to comment on an issue if they would like to work on it. Provide the team as much supporting details as possible (a test case that demonstrates a bug), with suggestions on how to solve the issue. This can be done in the form of an issue on the Lilypad GitHub. 

### Open an issue

When you open a issue, you will be presented with an option to open a feature request or report a bug. Please do your best to fill out the details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure how to answer.

- Ask for more information if you believe your issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Flag existing issues that are stale or that should be closed.

### Claim an issue

We will ask community members to comment on an issue if they would like to work on it. They can make a comment like “I would like to work on this issue” and that will claim the issue.

If an issue is claimed, but work on the issue in not progressing, a Lilypad team member will ping the contributor to ask them if they want to continue work on the issue. If they do not wish to continue or we do not get a timely response, we will comment and open the issue up to another contributor.

### Triage a bug report

Once an issue has been opened, there will often be discussion about the issue internally and in the community. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue, including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This is a part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Contributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much as possible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you choose to comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs to be fixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is incorrect, explain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong.

### Resolve an issue

In the majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request. The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request is similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the Lilypad Network.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are how changes are made to the code and docs in the Lilypad Network.

Pull requests of any size are greatly appreciated. To stay aligned with our team, we request that contributors first open an issue describing any proposed, non-trivial change to get feedback and a check whether the work is likely to be merged.

We encourage the community to review any PR on any repo in the [Lilypad GitHub organization](https://github.com/Lilypad-Tech)!

*Note:* any pull request created for an issue that already has someone else assigned **will be closed without review**.

### Commits

TODO conventional commits

### Signed commits

We require commits to be signed before they can be merged to `main`. Signing commits proves their authenticity. 

**Create a new SSH key pair**

Configuring signed commits has gotten quite a bit easier now that GitHub allows you to sign with SSH keys.

```yaml
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<yourname>@example.com"
```

The last part is a comment. You could add something like “git signing key” if you want extra information to identify the key’s purpose.

You’ll be asked where you want to store the key and if you want to protect it with a passphrase. Adding a passphrase is more secure, but you will need to enter it each time you commit or set up an agent to help with that.

You will also need to configure `git` to use the signing key. See this [guide](https://vanjacosic.com/posts/sign-your-git-commits-using-ssh-keys/#prepare-git-for-signing) for `git` configuration options.

**Upload public key to GitHub**

After creating the key pair, upload the public key to GitHub. See this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account) and make sure to select “Signing Key” for the key type.

**Verify configuration**

Use this [guide](https://vanjacosic.com/posts/sign-your-git-commits-using-ssh-keys/#testing) on signing your git commits using SSH keys shows how to test signed commits locally. If you push the commits to GitHub, you will see a “Verified” badge next to your commit.

### Tests

When a Pull Request is submitted, integration tests will run. The pull request must pass integration tests before we will merge it. We may merge some pull requests, such as changes to the docs without the integration test requirement.

### **Opening the Pull Request**

From within GitHub, opening a new Pull Request will present you with a pull request template. Please do your best to fill out the details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure how to answer.

Pull requests should document how to test new features or bug fixes. If we are unable to test the pull request, we may request additional context.

Pull request titles should follow the conventional commit format. We automatically create releases based on the pull request title. Pull requests with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `refactor` titles will create a release.

### Reviewing contributions

PR review from members of the community are greatly encouraged and will assist the team in the final assessment of the PR. Reviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving the contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. If there are reasons why you feel the PR should not land, explain what those are. 

Reviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other reviewers are strictly counter to the Code of Conduct.

### Abandoned pull requests

If a Pull Request appears to be abandoned or has not seen any activity, please first check with the contributor to see if they intend to continue the work before asking if they would like you to take over the work. In this scenario, it is courteous to give the original contributor credit for work that has been already completed (use the `Author:`  or `Co-authored-by:` metadata tags in the commit to attribute with name and email)

## Rewards

We tag some issues with a `community` tag to invite the community to work on them. Work on these issues is eligible rewards once they have been resolved with an associated pull request.

Community issues can be claimed by commenting that you would like to work on the issue. Please be respectful of other community members if they have already claimed an issue. If an issue is claimed, but the work is not progressing, a Lilypad team member will comment to indicate the issue is open to claim again.

If you submit a new issue requesting a feature or reporting a bug, please indicate if you would like to work on the issue. At our discretion, we may determine the issue is eligible for rewards, and we will tag it with the `community` tag and ping you to let you know. The issue must contain a detailed description and an explanation of how it will benefit the project.
